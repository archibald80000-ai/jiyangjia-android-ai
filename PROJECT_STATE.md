## Verified facts

- Android target system: Android 12.
- Existing cloud server: 8 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM, 10 Mbps, no GPU.
- LiveTalking upstream repository identified.
- Upstream lock target: `c963ad409c556918b7d23999bf87c47a7c05c932`.
- Local original knowledge materials exist outside this repository and are not yet curated.
- Local synchronized workspace is present at `E:\work\ai-kefu\jiyangjia-ai`.
- Repository structure verification passed with `scripts/verify_repository.ps1`.
- Project identity has been aligned to `archibald80000-ai/jiyangjia-android-ai`.
- TASK-000 ran on branch `task/TASK-000-project-bootstrap`.
- `.env.local` is ignored and was absent during the audit; values were not read.
- No tracked `.env`, private key, APK, model, audio or database file matched the TASK-000 scans.
- JSON/YAML example validation passed.
- Local tools found: Git, Python, Conda, FFmpeg, NVIDIA driver/CUDA via `nvidia-smi`, Java and GitHub CLI.
- LiveTalking locked checkout exists at ignored `third_party/LiveTalking` with HEAD `c963ad409c556918b7d23999bf87c47a7c05c932`.
- TASK-001 upstream audit completed on branch `task/TASK-001-livetalking-upstream-audit`.
- Static audit confirms LiveTalking exposes `/offer`, `/whep`, `/human`, `/humanaudio`, `/interrupt_talk`, `/is_speaking`, `/record`, `/record/{sessionid}`, `/set_audiotype`, `/sse`, admin routes, avatar task routes and conditional `/api/asr` at the locked commit.
- TASK-001 did not modify the ignored upstream checkout.
- TASK-002 completed on branch `task/TASK-002-livetalking-environment`.
- Isolated local runtime exists at ignored `.venv\livetalking-task002` with Python `3.12.13`.
- Local runtime installed `torch 2.9.1+cu126`, `torchvision 0.24.1+cu126`, `torchaudio 2.9.1+cu126` and upstream LiveTalking requirements.
- PyTorch CUDA smoke test passed in the isolated runtime: CUDA available, one NVIDIA GPU detected, device name `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU`, tensor sum returned `4.0`.
- `pip check` passed inside the isolated runtime.
- Global Python remained unmodified for torch after TASK-002.
- `scripts/start_livetalking.ps1` exists as a thin launcher for the isolated environment.

## Not yet verified

- Android CPU architecture and screen resolution.
- USB Host / USB Audio Class support.
- Whether APK sideloading and ADB are enabled.
- Android SDK/ADB and Gradle availability.
- LiveTalking model weights and Avatar assets.
- WebRTC connectivity on the target network.
- LiveTalking service startup and Wav2Lip runtime behavior.
- Real Doubao ASR/TTS/LLM credentials and API behavior.
- Production domain, TLS certificate, firewall and TURN strategy.
- Whether the expanded local framework should replace the current GitHub `main` content or be published through a review branch.

## Current milestone

**M1 — LiveTalking reproducible baseline**

Exit criteria:

- Locked upstream source audited and runtime requirements understood.
- Isolated LiveTalking environment created.
- Wav2Lip model/avatar assets prepared with source/license/hash records.
- WebRTC/WHEP and core LiveTalking API behavior verified with real local evidence.

Current evidence:

- `docs/evidence/2026-08-06-local-sync-audit.md`
- `docs/evidence/TASK-000/environment-audit.md`
- `docs/evidence/TASK-001/upstream-audit.md`
- `docs/evidence/TASK-002/environment-matrix.md`

Recent task results:

- DONE. `scripts/bootstrap_livetalking.ps1` completed with process-scoped Git config `http.version=HTTP/1.1`; `third_party/LiveTalking` is a real ignored Git checkout at `c963ad409c556918b7d23999bf87c47a7c05c932`. No model weights or avatar packages were downloaded.
- TASK-001 DONE. Upstream README/API/config/source/license were audited and summarized. Static endpoint and integration boundaries are recorded in `docs/evidence/TASK-001/upstream-audit.md` and `docs/03_LIVETALKING_SCOPE.md`. No service, model, WebRTC or provider runtime success is claimed.
- TASK-002 DONE. A local ignored Conda runtime was created at `.venv\livetalking-task002`; PyTorch CUDA and LiveTalking dependency import checks passed. No model, avatar, service startup, WebRTC or provider success is claimed.

Next action:

- Start `TASK-003_WAV2LIP_WEBRTC_BASELINE.md` on its own task branch/session. Prepare real Wav2Lip model/avatar assets with source/license/hash evidence, then test LiveTalking service startup and WebRTC/WHEP baseline. Do not claim model/WebRTC success without runtime logs.

## Status vocabulary

- `PLANNED`: documented but not started.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: authorized and actively being executed.
- `PARTIAL`: useful work completed but acceptance criteria not fully met.
- `BLOCKED`: cannot proceed without a concrete dependency.
- `DONE`: acceptance criteria passed with evidence.
- `DEFERRED`: intentionally postponed by product decision.
